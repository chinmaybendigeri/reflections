What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When any respository is initialized,git starts to keep track of that repository.It creates a .git, initially it doesnt contain any commits.We initialize repository to keep track of the files in the repository.  




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

Repository keeps track of all the files in the directory,staging area serves as an intermediate between the repository and the working directory,working directory contains single/mutilple files for a single commit.well, we can choose to add multiple files to a staging area and commit once for those files.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?



we add only one file at a time to the staging area and commit it in the working directory.
